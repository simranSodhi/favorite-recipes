        <p>In 2007, we started Favorite Family Recipes as a way for our own family to share our cherished family recipes with each other. These were the recipes of our grandmothers, our mother, and our aunts. So many of them were carefully kept in an old brown recipe box by our mom. Some were written in pencil, or had splashes of food on them. Some were folded and bent. To us, they were buried treasure, and this blog gave us a way to preserve them for ourselves, our children, and future grandchildren.

          Our fondness for family recipes goes back as long as we can remember. Growing up in our family of seven, the homemade dinners we gathered to share each night were not just about the food. Dinnertime was the one time each day all of us were together. And that was always thanks to our mom – the gatherer – who loved us so much that she made this possible nearly every night throughout our childhoods.

          Our fondness for family recipes goes back as long as we can remember. Growing up in our family of seven, the homemade dinners we gathered to share each night were not just about the food. Dinnertime was the one time each day all of us were together. And that was always thanks to our mom – the gatherer – who loved us so much that she made this possible nearly every night throughout our childhoods.
          
          Over the past eleven years, what started as a little online family project grew far more than we could have ever imagined. We’ve now published and developed over 1,000 recipes here on blog, we’ve welcomed more than 2 million visitors a month, and we’ve even published a series of cookbooks.
          
          But however much we grow and make, the best part is being there for you. There’s not a day that goes by that we don’t get to hear a great food story from you about making one of our recipes.
          </p>
         
          <p>
          “I pleased my kid, finally – he’s such a picky eater!”
    </p>
          
          <p>
          “I make a beautiful meal for my girlfriend and she was really impressed.”
      </p>
          
          <p>
          “That pie recipe you shared reminds me so much of my grandmother’s pie! Thank you for the sweet reminder to think of her.”
         
          </p>
          <p>
          This is what it’s all about. The same spark that started Favorite Family Recipes is what happens at Sunday dinners, family brunches, and other moments where food helps us celebrate. It’s the time we spend making it – the time we spend eating it together and talking – and the times we are brought back to, when we take a bite of something we truly love to eat.
          
          Here, you’re not going to find personal stories about the latest fashions or our running tips. These are stories we treasure about the food we share and the people it connects us to. This is where you can find quality-tested, classic recipes you can make to delight the people you love.
          
          We’ve been making food and making memories our whole lives. And whether you’re an ace at home-cooking or just giving it a first try, we’re here for you – welcome to the family.
